abstract = {Existing assistive technologies (AT) often adopt a one-size-fits-all approach, overlooking the diverse needs of people with visual impairments (PVI). Do-it-yourself AT (DIY-AT) toolkits offer one path toward customization, but most remain limited—targeting co-design with engineers or requiring programming expertise. Non-professionals with disabilities, including PVI, also face barriers such as inaccessible tools, lack of confidence, and insufficient technical knowledge. These gaps highlight the need for prototyping technologies that enable PVI to directly make their own AT. Building on emerging evidence that large language models (LLMs) can serve not only as visual aids but also as co-design partners, we present an exploratory study of how LLM-based AI can support PVI in the DIY-AT co-making process. Our findings surface key challenges and opportunities: the need for greater spatial and visual support, strategies for mitigating novel AI errors, and implications for designing more accessible AI-assisted prototyping.},

abstract = {There is currently no easy way to look up signs in sign language. Feature-based dictionaries help overcome this challenge by enabling users to look up a sign by inputting descriptive visual features, such as handshape and movement. However, feature-based dictionaries are typically cumbersome, including large numbers of complex features that the user must sort through. In this work, we explore simplifying the set of features used in feature-based American Sign Language (ASL) dictionaries. We present two studies: 1) a simulation study focused on lookup accuracy for various reduced feature sets, and 2) a user study focused on understanding human preferences between feature sets. Our results suggest that it is possible to dramatically reduce the number of features needed to search for signs without significantly impacting the accuracy of search results, and that smaller feature sets can improve the user experience in some cases.},

abstract = {Generative AI (AI) has become ubiquitous in both daily and professional life, with emerging research demonstrating its potential as a tool for accessibility. Neurodivergent people, often left out by existing accessibility technologies, develop their own ways of navigating normative expectations. GAI offers new opportunities for access, but it is important to understand how neurodivergent “power users”—successful early adopters—engage with it and the challenges they face. Further, we must understand how marginalization and intersectional identities influence their interactions with GAI. Our autoethnography, enhanced by privacy-preserving GAI-based diaries and interviews, reveals the intricacies of using GAI to navigate normative environments and expectations. Our findings demonstrate how GAI can both support and complicate tasks like code-switching, emotional regulation, and accessing information. We show that GAI can help neurodivergent users to reclaim their agency in systems that diminish their autonomy and self-determination. However, challenges such as balancing authentic self-expression with societal conformity, alongside other risks, create barriers to realizing GAI’s full potential for accessibility.},

abstract = {As Generative AI rises in adoption, its use has expanded to include domains such as hiring and recruiting. However, without examining the potential of bias, this may negatively impact marginalized populations, including people with disabilities. To address this important concern, we present a resume audit study, in which we ask ChatGPT (specifically, GPT-4) to rank a resume against the same resume enhanced with an additional leadership award, scholarship, panel presentation, and membership that are disability-related. We find that GPT-4 exhibits prejudice towards these enhanced CVs. Further, we show that this prejudice can be quantifiably reduced by training a custom GPTs on principles of DEI and disability justice. Our study also includes a unique qualitative analysis of the types of direct and indirect ableism GPT-4 uses to justify its biased decisions and suggest directions for additional bias mitigation work. Additionally, since these justifications are presumably drawn from training data containing real-world biased statements made by humans, our analysis suggests additional avenues for understanding and addressing human bias.},
