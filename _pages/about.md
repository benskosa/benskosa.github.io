I am a Ph.D. student at Department of Computer Science, [University of Wisconsin--Madison](https://www.cs.wisc.edu/) (UW-Madison), advised by [Dr. Yuhang Zhao](https://www.yuhangz.com/). I am currently supported by the NSF Graduate Research Fellowship (GRFP).

**My research currently focuses on developing systems that expand acces to information, in particular for people with disabilities**. I have a particular interest in enabling the Blind and Low Vision (BLV), as well as Deaf and Hard of Hearing (DHH) communities. My work is interdisciplinary, combining **Human-Computer Interaction**, **Applied Machine Learning**, and **Accessibility**.

Prior to UW-Madison, I earned my Bachelors in Computer Science at the [University of Washington--Seattle](https://www.cs.washington.edu/who-we-are/). During my undergrad, I spent time doing Human-AI x Accessibility research at both Microsoft Research (advised by [Dr. Danielle Bragg](https://danibragg.com/) and [Dr. Alex Lu](https://www.alexluresearch.com/)) and Gallaudet Univeristy (advised by [Dr. Raja Kushalnagar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=2fs6tyAAAAAJ&hl=en)).

<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
